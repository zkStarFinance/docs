# Decentralized Exchange

## The next-generation Multi-Pool technology&#x20;

`Allow zkStar DEX to integrate various pool models, each optimized for different use cases.`

At zkStar, we're committed to providing our users with a top-notch decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers high capital efficiency and a seamless user experience. That's why we've developed next-generation Multi-Pool technology, which allows our zkStar DEX to integrate various pool models, each optimized for different use cases.

Our Multi-Pool technology allows us to offer a range of pool models, such as Constant Product (CP), Constant Sum (CS), and Weighted Average Price (WAP), among others. Each pool model has its own advantages and use cases, and by integrating them into our DEX, we're able to offer users a wide range of trading options and liquidity providers.

Our Multi-Pool technology also allows us to offer advanced features such as automated market making, which ensures that prices remain stable even during periods of high volatility. This ensures that all trades are executed at fair and consistent prices, providing users with a highly reliable and efficient trading experience.

By leveraging next-generation Multi-Pool technology, zkStar is able to offer users a decentralized exchange that is both highly efficient and customizable. Whether you're looking for high capital efficiency or a specific trading strategy, we have a pool model that's right for you. Join us today and experience the power of next-generation Multi-Pool technology on the zkSync Era network.

`Constant Product (CP), Constant Sum (CS), and Weighted Average Price (WAP) are all pool models used in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like zkStar.`

* `Constant Product (CP) is a pool model in which the product of the quantities of two tokens in the pool is constant. This means that as one token is bought, the price of the other token adjusts automatically to maintain the constant product. CP is commonly used in automated market making (AMM) DEXs like Uniswap.`
* `Constant Sum (CS) is a pool model in which the sum of the quantities of two tokens in the pool is constant. This means that as one token is bought, the quantity of the other token decreases proportionally to maintain the constant sum. CS is commonly used in curve-based AMM DEXs like Curve.`
* `Weighted Average Price (WAP) is a pool model in which the price of a token is determined by its weight in the pool. This means that tokens with higher weights have a higher price than tokens with lower weights. WAP is commonly used in hybrid DEXs like Balancer.`

`By integrating multiple pool models, like CP, CS, and WAP, into our SyncSwap DEX using our next-generation Multi-Pool technology, zkStar is able to offer users a wide range of liquidity options and trading strategies. This allows users to choose the pool model that best suits their trading needs and preferences.`
