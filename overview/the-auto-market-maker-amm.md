## zkStar's Multi-Pool based on Uniswap's Pool

While our next-generation Multi-Pool technology at zkStar is designed to support a wide range of liquidity providers and pool models, our initial implementation is based on the popular Uniswap Pool model.

The Uniswap Pool model is an automated market making (AMM) algorithm that maintains a constant product of two assets in a liquidity pool. This means that as users trade one asset for another, the price of each asset adjusts automatically based on the balance of each asset in the pool.

By using the Uniswap Pool model as the basis for our Multi-Pool technology, we're able to provide users with a familiar and proven trading experience. However, our Multi-Pool technology also enables us to customize the Uniswap Pool model and make it more efficient and capital-efficient for our users.

For example, our Multi-Pool technology allows us to aggregate liquidity across multiple Uniswap Pools, which can help to reduce trading fees and increase capital efficiency. We can also combine the Uniswap Pool model with other pool models, like Constant Sum (CS) or Weighted Average Price (WAP), to offer users even more flexibility and customization options.

Overall, our Multi-Pool technology at zkStar is based on the Uniswap Pool model, but we've designed it to be highly flexible and customizable, so that we can provide our users with the best possible trading experience.
